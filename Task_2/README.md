# 🔍 Customer Churn Prediction System

This project is part of my internship at **Future Interns**, where I built a Machine Learning system to predict customer churn using real-world telecom-style data.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To develop a Churn Prediction System that helps businesses identify customers likely to leave a service. This allows companies to take preventive actions and improve customer retention.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: `Churn_Modelling.csv`
- Fields include: Credit Score, Age, Tenure, Geography, Gender, Balance, Products, etc.
- Target variable: `Exited` (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Metabase for visualization
- VS Code + Git for development

---

## 🧠 Model

- **Model Used**: XGBoost Classifier
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC AUC
- **Output**: Churn prediction + probability for each customer

---

## 📊 Visualization

- Results visualized using Metabase dashboards.
- Key insights into churn drivers: Age, Geography, Product count, etc.
